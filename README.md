## The notebooks in this repository are from my final year of college, where I worked on my Analytics degree. They demonstrate my work with various 
## data analysis and machine learning techniques, including:

- **Data manipulation** with Pandas
- **Data visualization** using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- **Numerical computations** with NumPy
- **Machine learning** with scikit-learn, including:
  - `train_test_split` (Data splitting)
  - `neighbors` (K-Nearest Neighbors)
  - `tree` (Decision Trees)
  - `metrics` (Model evaluation)
- **Statistical analysis** with Statsmodels

## These notebooks showcase a variety of graphing, calculations, and data analysis tasks I performed during my studies.
